# docz-plugin-react-native

Use your React Native components inside docz

> We're using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to make this integration possible. So, maybe you can have some caveats.

## Instalation

Just add and use the plugin inside your `doczrc.js`

```js
import { reactNative } from 'docz-plugin-react-native'

export default {
  plugins: [reactNative()]
}
```

That's it 🙌🏻

# Document settings

Document settings provide a way to enrich documents with metadata used to generate your documentation site.

They are defined at the top of the `.mdx` file, use YAML and can be used to customize your pages by passing this data to your theme.

Every document has **three** main properties that can be overriden :

```markdown
---
name: My Document
route: /custom-route
menu: Documents
---
```

- `name` The name of your document, used as the title of the page
- `route *(optional)*` The route or path to your document's generated page. e.g. /docs/my-component

> If you don't pass any here, docz will create a slug using the filepath of your file as route. e.g. /src-components-my-components/

- `menu  *(optional)*` The menu within which your document is contained. It allows you to group documents into a single menu by changing this prop.

## Custom properties

The built in properties are for docz but docz is extensible and you can create your own themes which could need different properties.

Custom properties can be set in the document settings and they will automatically be parsed.

For example you could define a property called `fullpage` to define whether your document is a page with `100%` width or not:

```
---
name: My Document
fullpage: true
---
```

You could then use this property when overriding or creating a theme as shown in [**Creating your themes: Using documents settings**](/docz/creating-your-themes#using-documents-settings)

# Introduction

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-heavy processes when developing software.

A lot of time is spent on building and maintaining custom documentation sites.

**Docz** was created to solve this problem.

Docz enables you to quickly create live-reloading, seo-friendly, production-ready documentation sites with MDX and customize the look, feel and behavior when required by leveraging GatsbyJS and Gatsby theme shadowing.

## Principles

We started by looking over the options available when you want to create your design system or document your project. We borrowed the best ideas from each and came up with the following guiding principles :

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** Avoid unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX based.** Use the best standard for writing documentation.

Now that you know the core principles of Docz. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!

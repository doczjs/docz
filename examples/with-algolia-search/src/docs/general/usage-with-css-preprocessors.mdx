# Using docz with CSS Preprocessors

Most configuration is from version 2 handled by Gatsby, and CSS preprocessing is no exception. Gatsby uses a range of [**Plugins**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) to handle things like `sass`, `less` and `postcss`. Gatsby supports CSS Modules out of the box.

These plugins are added by adding a `gatsby-config.js` in your project root or modifying an existing one. For example if you want to add support for `sass` you would do the following:

1. Install [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [`gatsby-plugin-sass`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/)
```bash
# npm
npm install --save node-sass gatsby-plugin-sass

# yarn
yarn add node-sass gatsby-plugin-sass
```

2. Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`
```js
//gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-sass']
}
```
You should now be able to use `sass` in your components!

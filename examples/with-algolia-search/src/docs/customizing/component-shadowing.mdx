# Component Shadowing

All components that comes with the standard theme `gatsby-theme-docz` can be [**shadowed**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/). This means that you can supply your own component that will shadow/override the themes component. This is done by placing a component with the same name as the themes component in the "same filepath" as the original component.

For example if you want to shadow the `Logo`-component you would have to have the following structure in your folder:

```
your-site
└── src
    └── gatsby-theme-docz
        └── components
            └── Logo
                  └──index.js
```

If it has the matching folder structure and name the theme component will be shadowed and you can freely edit.

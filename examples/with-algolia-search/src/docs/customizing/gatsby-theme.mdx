# Gatsby Theme

If you want to use Docz in a Gatsby application, you can use `gatsby-theme-docz`.

Gatsby themes is one of the coolest features of all time in Gatsby. With the introduction of theming in Gatsby, it's easier than ever to get started building a Gatsby site. Shared functionality, data sourcing, and design can all be prepackaged as a Gatsby Theme that's an NPM install away.

Our theme has all components and algorithms used to render your documentation website, with it we can explore a lot of Gatsby features and put all this things together in order
to create a really useful documentation website.
With `gatsby-theme-docz` you can get the full power of docz in your existing Gatsby app.

If you're not sure what a Gatsby theme is, please read [the official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/introduction/)

## How to use

First, install some packages:

```
yarn add gatsby gatsby-theme-docz@next docz@next react react-dom
```

Then set the `gatsby-theme-docz` in the `plugins` option inside your `gatsby-config.js`

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-theme-docz'],
}
```

Then, add some `.mdx` in your project:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
route: /
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

Now just run gatsby in development mode:

```bash
$ yarn gatsby develop
```

If everything works, you should see something like this:

## Configuration

Set your config by using `doczrc.js` file ([see all available](https://www.docz.site/docs/project-configuration)) or if you want to
set some defaults for your theme, use `options` in the plugin definition:

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-docz',
      options: {
        /* your custom options */
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

> We highly recommend that you set your configuration using `doczrc.js` because of live reload that will change in real time your project settings, if you set your configs using the theme definition you will need to reset your dev server in order to see your changes.

## Dark Mode

To set the dark version as default, just set your `doczrc.js` like that:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    mode: 'dark',
  },
}
```

## Customizing components

Components shadowing is one of the best things included in the new Gatsby theme feature, with it, it is possible to replace theme files just by creating your own file following a file naming convention.

Example: If you're using our `gatsby-theme-docz` which has a `Header` component located at `src/components/Header/index.js` you can override the component by creating `src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/Header/index.js`. Cool right?

## Adding your logo

So, now that you know about how component shadowing works on Gatsby themes, if you don't want to override the entire `<Header>` component but just change your logo inside it, your can shadow the `<Logo>` component used in the header just by creating your own at `src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/Logo/index.js`

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/Logo/index.js
import React from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'

export const Logo = () => <img src={logo} alt="That's my logo" />
```

Easy, right?

## Creating your own Docz theme

One of the coolest thing of Docz is that you can create your own theme if you want from scratch and keep all docz's benefits.

Previously, this was accomplished by using the `theme` property inside the `doczrc.js` file.

Starting from v2, if you want to create your own theme, just create a file located at `src/gatsby-theme-docz/index.js`

```js
import React from 'react'
import { theme, useConfig, ComponentsProvider } from 'docz'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import baseComponents from 'gatsby-theme-docz/src/components'

import { Menu } from './MyBeautifulMenu'

const componentsMap = {
  ...baseComponents,
  /* your custom components */,
}

const Theme = ({ children }) => {
  const config = useConfig()
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={config}>
      <Menu />
      <ComponentsProvider components={baseComponents}>
        {children}
      </ComponentsProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

const themeConfig = {
  colors: {
    primary: 'tomato',
    secondary: 'khaki',
    gray: 'lightslategray',
  },
}

export default theme(themeConfig)(Theme)
```

More info about [here](/docs/creating-your-themes)

## Wrapping the entire app

Sometime you need to wrap your entire application in order to add some `Provider` or just to load some script. You can do this easily inside our theme by creating a file located at `src/gatsby-theme-docz/wrapper.js`

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-docz/index.js
import React from 'react'

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>My custom wrapper</h1>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

## Theme UI integrated

Docz's code uses [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) as the default theme system.

[Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) is a library for building consistent, themeable React apps based on constraint-based design principles.

You can modify the default theme and create your own style by combining these modifications with component shadowing.

Check our [base theme object](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/blob/feat/gatsby/core/gatsby-theme-docz/src/theme/index.js) to see the properties.

To create your own theme definition use the `doczrc.js` and set your properties in the `themeConfig` like that:

```js
// doczrc.js
export default {
  themeConfig: {
    colors: {
      header: {
        bg: 'tomato',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Or, to create your own theme, just create this file in the root of your project: `src/gatsby-theme-docz/theme/index.js`.

```js
import baseTheme from 'gatsby-theme-docz/src/theme'
import { merge } from 'lodash/fp'

export default merge(baseTheme, {
  colors: {
    header: {
      bg: 'tomato',
    },
  },
})
```

## Changing code highlight

Both code highlights shortcodes and the `<Playground>` component use [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) to highlight the code.
If you want to modify and use another PrismJS theme, you can do that just passing a `prismTheme` property for your theme.

```js
// doczrc.js
import myCustomPrismTheme from './my-prism-theme'

export default {
  themeConfig: {
    prismTheme: myCustomPrismTheme,
  },
}
```

Or you want to have different themes for `light` and `dark` color mode, you can change the `prism` default property like that:

```js
// doczrc.js
import customLightTheme from './my-light-theme'
import customDarkTheme from './my-dark-theme'

export default {
  themeConfig: {
    prism: {
      light: customLightTheme,
      dark: customDarkTheme,
    },
  },
}
```

## Adding component shortcodes

You can add shortcodes to your docs site which can be used throughout
your docs pages by extending the components passed to MDXProvider. You
can do this by using component shadowing and creating the following file
in the root of your project: `src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/index.js`.

### Example `components.js`

```js
import baseComponents from 'gatsby-theme-documentation/src/components'
import MyCustomH1 from '../components/my-custom-h1'

export default {
  ...baseComponents,
  h1: MyCustomH1,
}
```

## Getting data

Using our Gatsby Theme you can use all Gatsby hooks to get data for your pages and from Gatsby.
So, you can create isolated pages on Gatsby using gatsby pages and get data from Docz or maybe pass data
for your Docz documents using source from gatsby.

Imagine, that you have your home page inside `/pages` and you want to show all documents parsed from Docz. You can get this by doing:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useDocs } from 'docz'

const Home = () => {
  const docs = useDocs()
  return <div>{/* my coolest home */}</div>
}

export default Home
```

Or you can have a mdx document inside Docz that has data from Gatsby too:

```markdown
---
name: MyDoc
---

import { MyComponentWithSomeData } from './my-component-with-data'

<MyComponentWithSomeData />
```

Cool right?

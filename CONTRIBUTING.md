# Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are very welcome. If you are using this package and fixed a bug for yourself, please consider submitting a PR! Also you can ping me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pedronauck)

## Guidelines

If you will develop some pull request, it's very important follow these basic rules:

### Commit messages

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.

### General guidelines

- The master branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branch. **Do not submit PRs against the master branch.**
- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `dev`, and merge back against that branch.
- Work in the **src** folder of respective package and **DO NOT** checkin dist in the commits.
- It's OK - and a very nice thing - to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

### If adding new feature:

- Make sure that [all examples](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/examples) are running as expected
- Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

- *Node:* `^9.0.0`
- *Yarn:* `^1.7.0`

### Install

Check out the code and go into the docz directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedronauck/docz.git
cd docz
```

Then run yarn install and bootstrap all packages:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn bs
```

After that, just run `packages` script to format, build and lint all packages:

```bash
$ yarn packages
```

## Developing

There's just few things that you need to know to start developing on docz

### Project structure

There's a lot of [packages](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages) that are necessary to run docz, but basically has just two that you need to know more about:

#### **[docz-core](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz)**
- This is the core of docz. All build algorithms, server process and parses belongs to here.
- If you break this package, probably you'll break all packages! Please, be carefull.
- All cli commands are built here and imported on `docz` package using `./bin` script.
- Do not create scripts that's running on browser here, just node scripts.

#### **[docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz)**
- Main and top level package.
- Scripts that's running on browser belongs to this package
- Built-ins components are built here, most specifically on [this folder](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/packages/docz/src/components)
- This package shouldn't have any component style, just boilerplate and logic!

### Watching projects

To speed up your develop process:
- Split your terminal openning the packages that you need to develop and running `yarn dev` in each window.
- After that, use any of this splitted window to run `yarn dev` in some [example](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/examples) to run it, like that:

![](https://cdn-std.dprcdn.net/files/acc_649651/MdH4FL)

Now you're watching `docz`, `docz-core` and `docz-theme-default` and running `docz-example-basic`. So, any modificationmade on any package will reflect on basic example on the fly!

### Creating plugins

If has some plugin that you want to create, please contact-me before to talk about the possibility to make this plugin official!

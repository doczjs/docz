# Docz

Docz makes it easy to write and publish beautiful interactive documentation for your code.
Create MDX files showcasing your code and Docz turns them into a live-reloading, production-ready site.

## Why?

Documenting code is one of the most important and time-consuming tasks when developing software.

A lot of time is spent on building and maintaining custom documentation sites.

Docz enables you to quickly create a live-reloading, SEO-friendly, production-ready documentation site with MDX and customize the look, feel and behavior when required by leveraging [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Gatsby theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/shadowing/).

## Getting started

Start by adding `docz` as a dependency to your project with Yarn or npm:

```bash
$ yarn add docz # react react-dom

# or

$ npm install docz # react react-dom
```

> **Note**: `react` and `react-dom` will not be installed automatically. You'll have to install them yourself.

Then, create `.mdx` files anywhere in your project:

```mdx
---
name: Button
route: /
---

import { Playground, Props } from 'docz'
import Button from './Button'

# Button

<Props of={Button} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button type="submit">Click me</Button>
  <Button>No, click me</Button>
</Playground>
```

And a Button component `Button.jsx`:

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import t from 'prop-types'

const Button = ({ children, type }) => <button type={type}>{children}</button>

Button.propTypes = {
  /**
   * This is a description for this prop.
   * Button type.
   */
  type: t.oneOf(['button', 'submit', 'reset']),
}
Button.defaultProps = {
  type: 'button',
}
export default Button
```

Finally, run:

```bash
yarn docz dev
```

This starts a local development server and opens your documentation site in the browser.

## Build

`yarn docz build` generates a static site in `.docz/dist/`.

Try it with `yarn docz serve` or by serving the generated site with your favorite static file server (e.g. `npx serve .docz/dist`).

You can have `yarn docz build` emit to a different directory by providing a path to the `dest` field in your `doczrc.js` or from the command line: `yarn docz build --dest docs-site-directory`.

## Deploying

The output of docz consists of static assets only.
This allows you to deploy your generated `docz` site with any static site hosting provider you'd like.

Start by building your site with `yarn docz build`, if you haven't provided a `dest` flag to your config then you will find your generated files in `.docz/dist` to copy to the server.
